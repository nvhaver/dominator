## DOMinator Virtual Appliance ##

If you want to try it without installing it, [Mario Heiderich](https://heideri.ch/) setup a Ubuntu Virtual Appliance with DOMinator already installed.

Anyone that could not install it because of lack of support for some OS, can try it using [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/).

Consider that this version of DOMinator uses a lot of memory and CPU resources so the
more resources you give to the VM the best DOMinator will run.

You can download it from here:
